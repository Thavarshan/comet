## Project Overview

Comet's goal is to provide a **free, user-friendly, and visually appealing** application for converting media files. Whether you need to convert a single file or multiple files at once, Comet is designed to make the process straightforward.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Video, Audio, and Image Conversion:**
  - Video formats: MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, etc.
  - Audio formats: MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC, etc.
  - Image formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, ICO, ICNS, etc.
- **Bulk File Conversion:** Easily upload and convert multiple files in one go.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking:** Track the progress of each conversion with real-time feedback.
- **Dark Mode:** A sleek dark theme for more comfortable use.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Available in multiple languages for a global audience.
- **Cancel/Resume Conversions:** Cancel ongoing conversions, with options to manage individual items in the queue.
- **Jimp and FFmpeg Integration:** Use Jimp for images and FFmpeg for audio/video conversion.

## Recent Updates

- **Unified Conversion Handler:** We’ve refactored the media conversion process to use an **Adapter Pattern**, allowing for a unified conversion handler for video, audio, and image files using either **FFmpeg** or **Jimp**, depending on the file type.
- **Advanced Testing:** Expanded unit tests using **Jest** to cover media conversion handlers and IPC processes.
- **Improved Performance:** Faster conversions through optimizations in how we handle bulk file uploads and media processing queues.
- **Enhanced UI and UX:** A more responsive interface and clearer progress tracking for large file batches.

## Technologies Used

- **Electron:** For building the cross-platform desktop application.
- **Vue.js (with Composition API and TypeScript):** For the frontend UI.
- **FFmpeg & Jimp:** Core engines for media conversion (video/audio via FFmpeg, images via Jimp).
- **Node.js:** Backend services and media processing.
- **Vite:** Modern build tool for fast development.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
- **i18n:** Internationalization for multi-language support.
- **Jest:** For unit testing.
- **GitHub Actions:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and release automation.
