### Code Style and Guidelines

- **Code Quality**: Please write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- **Consistency**: Follow the existing code style in the repository. We use ESLint and Prettier for enforcing code style, so make sure your code passes all linting checks.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. If your change is related to an issue, include the issue number in the commit message (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

We appreciate contributions to our documentation. If you’ve added a new feature, or found that some parts of the documentation could be improved, feel free to submit a PR.

1. **Docs Location**: Most of the documentation is located in the `README.md` or within the `docs/` folder if it exists.
